# Original Support

In this experiment we look at the rules we extracted from the `APISan` and `JUXTA` papers. We try and measure, for each rule, what level of support the rule has in a set of Abstract Traces extracted from a recent version of the linux kernel.

Why: ideally, we will have good support for all the rules. If we don't have good support then we are missing something (either due to lack of precision, bugs, or infeasible paths).
